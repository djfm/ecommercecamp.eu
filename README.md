This is PrestaShop's presentation for the 2015 [ecommercecamp.eu](ecommerce-camp.eu) barcamp in Jena!

The presentation is hosted [on the gh-pages branch](http://djfm.github.io/ecommercecamp.eu).

It is made with the awesome [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) because we love the web and doing presentations is HTML is a lot of fun.
